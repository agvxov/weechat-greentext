# Weechat-Greentext
Weechat script for applying imageboard formatting to messages. The following are supported:
 + greentext
 + purpletext
 + redtext

Both inbound and outbound messages are colored.
Since the coloring uses IRC color codes,
outbound greentexting will be visible to both you and your friends.
